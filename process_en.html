   <i>Daxtrot</i> is based on 
<a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=13452">an
earlier idea by a user called miconazole that she posted about</a> for
a game jam in 2010. Our work on <i>Daxtrot</i> started with a
<a href="?nav=skisse">simple proposal (in Norwegian)</a> outlining the
basic concept. We decided to make the hero of the game a dachshound –
since dachshouds, shaped almost entirely cylindrical, could be
interesting to navigate in a game, but mostly because they're
irresistibly cute.

  We based our work on a simple Flappy Bird-clone on 
   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/tryit.asp?filename=trygame_default_gravity">w3schools</a>
   that already had some of the mechanics we were looking for, and
   started building on this.

   We then placed the sprite on the ground, added two smaller shapes
    on top of the big one, and put various hinders in the way.

   Later we got original sprites (by Simen) for all the elements, and
   the game started looking like we had imagined.

  In the final process, we worked to get a proper level layout (as
   opposed to a randomized endless runne), an option to configure the
   controls, more obstacles, a main menu, support for mobile devices,
   and a couple of tutorial crows.
